# ACNH-Turnip-Price-Check-Automater
Uses Reddit API to read titles of what people are posting. Uses the title and converts the turnip price (whether its text or numbers) into a readable format.  When a new post is grabbed, it sends a system notification that you can click on to open the page.

*Future Additions:*
- Minimum price for receiving notifications
- GUI (?)
- More word to number definitions (ongoing)
- TBD
